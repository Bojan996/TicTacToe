# TicTacToe

After cloning the prject, go to it's folder directory and run npm install in the terminal.
After that, run npm start to start the game and enjoy!

The AI is unbeatable (at least i think, judging by my tests and knowledge :D) thus making it a little borring after a couple of tries.
Search through the computerLogic function and find a comment that tells you the instructions of how to make it slightly beatable, then give it a trie, it's fun!

As for the player VS player, go ahead and try it out with your friends!
